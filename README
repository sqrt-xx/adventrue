Mina is a lightweight (22kb) zero knowledge blockchain. We decided to utilize Mina's unique properties to enable any user to create their own quest Adventrue game using zk technology to verify that the player solved the clues correctly and are entitled to a specific reward.
In our example we used Krakow as inspiration for the clues. We tried to make them easy enough to solve in a relatively short space of time. The reward for solving the puzzles can be anything, a MINA NFT, some spicy testnet MINA, or even a physical prize.
The concept has the potential to be expanded in many directions (Eg to create a global multi-player GEO-cache type adventure game integrating proof of geolocation)
