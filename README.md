# AdvenTRUE
## A true adventure, with zk. Complete and easily create “treasure hunt” style games with prizes on Mina. 
Mina is a lightweight (22kb) zero knowledge blockchain with smart contract functionality. We decided to utilize Mina's o1js smart contract to enable any user to create their own quest game with a mix of off-chain and on-chain dynamics.
In our example we used Krakow as inspiration for the questions. We tried to make them easy enough to solve in a relatively short space of time. The reward for solving the puzzles can be anything, a MINA NFT, some spicy testnet MINA, or even a physical prize.
The concept has the potential to be expanded in many directions. We were working on integrating zkLocus (Mina zkApp project) as a proof of geolocation, but were unable to fully incorporate in the time constraints.
