        <p>Mina is a lightweight zero knowledge (ZK) blockchain. It is themost advanced ZK blockchain for proving anything privately and securely.</p>
        <p>We decided to utilize Mina's unique properties to enable any user to create their own quest Adven-true game using zk technology to verify that the player solved the clues correctly and are entitled to a specific reward.</p>
        <p>In our example we used Krakow as inspiration for the clues. We tried to make them easy enough to solve in a relatively short space of time. </p>
        <p>The concept has the potential to be expanded in many directions. Eg, To create a global multi-player GEO-cache type adventure game, or on a less energetic level a way for users to ascertain they have completed a number of steps in order to be whitelisted for a certain rewards, or for example, to obtain a higher level of permissions into an online members club.</p>
